# odin-recipes
A Website for Recipes

This project is a website consisting of a few recipes with instructions to make different meals. Throughout this project, I will be demonstrating basic fundamentals of HTML through the use of proper file structure, content formatting, relative links, and embedded images. I will also be demonstrating basic use of Git through properly committing snapshots to GitHub.
